Genome-wide sequencing revealed pervasive transcription, where the majority of the DNA encodes non-coding RNAs. Non-coding RNAs and RNA-protein interactions play a fundamental role in cellular regulation; consequently they have received increasing attention over the past decade. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing as well as in the genome-wide identification of miRNAs and RNA-protein interactions have shown that the complexity of post-transcriptional gene regulation is equivalent to that of transcriptional gene regulation. 

The recently launched German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI) aims to provide comprehensive bioinformatics services to users in life sciences research, industry and medicine. Within this network, the RNA Bioinformatics Center (RBC) is responsible for supporting RNA related research in Germany, such as the detection of noncoding RNAs and RNA structure prediction. The RBC aspires to build and advance a movement of Galaxy based RNA bioinformatics and help foster a community of users and developers in this field.

This poster details the infrastructure, services and methods the RBC will employ to meet this challenge and how Galaxy is used to provide an integrated workbench for RNA analysis.
